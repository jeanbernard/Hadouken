# Hadouken!!!

A quick, hackathon style app to check out [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for video encoding/decoding and streaming my Street Fighter 6 clips.

## The Idea

Convert my local SF6 clips from H.264 to H.265, upload them to my Google Drive and then stream the clips on my local webserver using HLS.
